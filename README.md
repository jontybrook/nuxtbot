# NuxtBot

Welcome to the NuxtBot repository! This is an open-source, community-driven initiative to create an AI-powered assistant for developers using the Nuxt JS framework. At this stage, NuxtBot is a collaborative project for sharing experiments, code snippets, ideas, and datasets that will contribute to the development of an effective and helpful bot.
